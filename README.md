#### Project 1
Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated of 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. Machine learning applied to medical records, in particular, can be an effective tool both to predict the survival of each patient having heart failure symptoms (Latha, 2019), and to detect the most important clinical features (or risk factors) that may lead to heart failure (Lawler, 2019). Scientists can take advantage of machine learning not only for clinical prediction, but also for feature ranking. The incorporation of machine learning and data science has the potential to impact on clinical practice in the health care field, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction (Chicco, 2020). This project seeks to analyze and understand to see if we can create a predictive modeling to know when a patient will have a heart failure disease based on their given health attributes. It furthers test different machine learning models to find the most suitable predictive model.

### The repository contains the following materials:

- Project proposal
- Paper in PDF format
- Complete project code
- Video presentation

This is a compilation of materials for my first project in the course DSC 680 (Applied Data Science) at Bellevue University. This project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I build and train a model to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.

# A Data Story about a Bike that Goes Nowhere


Peloton® is a digital workout provider that sells fitness equipment along with a streaming subscription for cycling, strength, running, and other floor workouts. Motivation is a requirement for sticking to any routine. Knowing your motivating factors and using them strategically can lead to success in achieving your goals.  The online fitness community provides many avenues of motivation including community, convenience, competition, and data. Developing a reproducible method to identify the factors that can improve performance and results can allow users to benefit even more from their investment.  This project examined the Peloton® workout history for an individual user to determine the factors that influence their performance, correlation between workouts and weight, and improvement in overall fitness over time.  The relationships between performance metrics were identified during correlation analysis.  Visualization confirmed consistent activity overall was associated with weight loss; however, exercise was not the biggest contributing factor.  Modeling using a blended regression algorithm was able to successfully rate each workout based on the average metrics during the cycling workout.
Data was downloaded using a specific user account from the Peloton API and Apple Health Kit in the Data Wrangling Script.  To download your own data, you must have an active peloton account.  If you do not, you may use the datafiles included here:
- instructors.txt - Instructor information in JSON format
- workouts.txt - details on workouts completed in JSON format
- workout_summary.txt - general information about the workouts in JSON format.
- workout_performance.txt - performance metrics for each workout in JSON format.
- weight.csv - Apple health metrics
